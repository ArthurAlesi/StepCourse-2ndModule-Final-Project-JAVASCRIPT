# StepCourse-2ndModule-Final-Project-JAVASCRIPT
 This is my final project from Step Computer Academy Course developed with Javascript, Html and CSS

## Contextualizing
Step Computer Academy is a presencial course having filials all around the glove  <br>
Each module lasts 6 months and We studie a specific subject   <br>
At this module, I have studied Javscript after studing Html/CSS.  <br>
This is a simple solution. I haven't learned how to use cookies, servers or sessions.  <br>
So I just simulate a login. You can enter it with whatever "nickname" you want and put anything as a password too.  <br>
Then it will take you to another page built in javascript. It simultes a Shopping Cart. You can dynamicaly choose the items and the finish your order.

### 1st You can choose whatever you want as a name
<p>
 I put "Arthur" as a exemple. But it's just a test

### 2nd You will be redirected to another page
<p>
In this page you'll be abble to "make your order"  <br>
As you can see, your name choosen on login page is shown  on top of the page.  <br>
 it is marked in red.  <br>
 The cart is the part written "carinho". Cart is carrinho in portuguese  <br>
